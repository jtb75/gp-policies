    1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to **IAM > Roles**.
    2. Select the affected role.
    3. Choose the **Trust relationships** tab, then **Edit trust policy**.
    4. Remove any untrusted account ARNs from the `Principal.AWS` field.
    5. If the role is publicly assumable (`"Principal": "*"`), restrict it to specific trusted accounts.
    6. If the account should be trusted, add it to the trusted accounts list in the globals package.
